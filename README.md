1. HAVE A LOOK AT THE REPORT.PPT FOR AN IDEA ABOUT THE PROJECT.
2. OPEN COMMAND PROMPT, CREATE A NEW VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT AND RUN THE REQUIREMENTS.TXT FILE
   MOVE TO YOUR DIRECTORY WHERE REQUIREMENTS.TXT IS LOCATED AND USE 'pip intsall -r requirements.txt' TO INSTALL THE REQUIRED LIBRARIES.
3. I'VE USED MYSQL ALONG WITH THE XAMPP SERVER FOR THE DATABASE.
   CHANGE THE DATABASE AND THE NAME OF THE DATABASE ACCORDING TO YOUR NEEDS. CHECK SETTINGS.PY UNDER MACHAUTOMATION FOLDER, DATABASES(LINE 87)
4. IN CASE YOU FEEL BETTER WITH THE INBUILT DATABASE SYSTEM SQLITE3, COMMENT OUT THE LINES FROM 87 TO 96 AND UNCOMMENT LINES 77 TO 85 IN SETTINGS.PY UNDER MACHAUTOMATION FOLDER.
5. NOW YOU ARE READY TO GO...
   CREATE A SUPERUSER AND MIGRATE THE FILES AND GET THE SERVER RUNNING.
   USE THE COMMAND 'python manage.py createsuperuser' TO CREATE A SUPER USER
   MIGRATE THE FILES TO YOUR DATABASE USING 'python manage.py makemigrations'
 					    'python manage.py migrate'
					    'python manage.py runserver'
6. FEEL FREE TO MAKE SOME IMPROVISATIONS. :)


WITH LOVE, SAB.
